@@ The main research interest of our group is to understand the complex relationships between genome sequences and phenotypes and how these two features evolve across species. We generally use large-scale phylogenetics approaches that allow looking at the evolution of genomes from the perspective of all of their genes, and we apply these analyses to a variety of biological questions related the evolution and function of organelles, pathways, and protein and lncRNA families.
